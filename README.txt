VBA Chat Cleaning 

when run in excel vba, this set of files attempts to format the mobile phone chat reports generated by Cellebrite, to a clean and presentable evidential standard. 

The initial worksheet formatting arranges and creates a number of columns.
The individual platform named files then split and format the conversations, identifying the recipient based on the values of the sender and participants columns.
Conversations where there are more than two participants are identified as group conversations and incrementally named based upon the platform used.
